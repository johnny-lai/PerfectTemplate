# swift-service-basic

A sample basic swift webservice. Currently based on [PerfectTemplate](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate).

###Compatibility with Swift

This project works only with the Swift 3.0 toolchain available with Xcode 8.0+ or on Linux via [Swift.org](http://swift.org/).

## Swift version note:

Due to a late-breaking bug in Xcode 8, if you wish to run directly within Xcode, we recommend installing swiftenv and installing the Swift 3.0.1 preview toolchain.

```
# after installing swiftenv from https://swiftenv.fuller.li/en/latest/
swiftenv install https://swift.org/builds/swift-3.0.1-preview-1/xcode/swift-3.0.1-PREVIEW-1/swift-3.0.1-PREVIEW-1-osx.pkg
```

Alternatively, add to the "Library Search Paths" in "Project Settings" $(PROJECT_DIR), recursive.

## Building & Running

The following will clone and build an empty starter project and launch the server on port 8181.

```
git clone https://github.com/johnny-lai/swift-service-basic.git
cd swift-service-basic
make
.build/debug/SwiftServiceBasic
```

**If you see a build error concerning OpenSSL, please see the swift version or Library Search Paths recommendations above.**

You should see the following output:

```
Starting HTTP server on 0.0.0.0:8181 with document root ./webroot
```

This means the server is running and waiting for connections. Access [http://localhost:8181/](http://127.0.0.1:8181/) to see the greeting. Hit control-c to terminate the server.

## Starter Content

The template file contains a very simple "hello, world!" example.

```swift
import PerfectLib
import PerfectHTTP
import PerfectHTTPServer

// Create HTTP server.
let server = HTTPServer()

// Register your own routes and handlers
var routes = Routes()
routes.add(method: .get, uri: "/", handler: {
		request, response in
		response.appendBody(string: "<html><title>Hello, world!</title><body>Hello, world!</body></html>")
		response.completed()
	}
)

// Add the routes to the server.
server.addRoutes(routes)

// Set a listen port of 8181
server.serverPort = 8181

// Set a document root.
// This is optional. If you do not want to serve static content then do not set this.
// Setting the document root will automatically add a static file handler for the route /**
server.documentRoot = "./webroot"

// Gather command line options and further configure the server.
// Run the server with --help to see the list of supported arguments.
// Command line arguments will supplant any of the values set above.
configureServer(server)

do {
	// Launch the HTTP server.
	try server.start()
} catch PerfectError.networkError(let err, let msg) {
	print("Network error thrown: \(err) \(msg)")
}
```
